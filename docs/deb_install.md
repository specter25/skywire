In order to create the Skywire debian packages, make sure you are running a debian based distro.

To sign the debian packages, add both the public and secret key if not already.
Follow [this guide](https://www.debuntu.org/how-to-importexport-gpg-key-pair/) for more info.
 
```bash
$ gpg --import ~/mygpgkey_pub.gpg
$ gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import ~/mygpgkey_sec.gpg
```

Check if it is added correctly:
```bash
$ gpg --list-keys
```

Run the packaging make target. Make sure the `Author Email` and `Author Name` is the same as the key in `gpg --list-keys`:
(NOTE: the email should be the same as the email of the key you are sigining with)

The debian package should be created after a release has been made in `github.com/skycoin/skywire` and the version should follow the tag defined in the `skywire` repo. 

```bash
$ make deb-package

...
...
Version : 0.5.0
Author Email : someemail@email.com
Author Name : Some Name
```
The Version, Author Email, and Author Name needs to be added via the terminal in order to build the packages.

During its work script will create packages for the following architectures:
- amd64
- i386
- arm
- arm64
- armhf

For each architecture a changelog file will be created for a package and will be opened with the editor. Apply needed changes and save it.

The script will complain that there's no original code tarball. Ignore the warning by pressing `y`. 

Once the script finishes, you'll see a `deb` directory in you current folder. This is where the finished packages are. Put these to `/var/www/repos/apt/debian` on the `apt server` and remove the old packages there. 

To sign the packages use:<br>
(NOTE: the email should be the same as the one used in `make deb-package`. as well as the email of the key you are sigining with)
```bash
$ ./scripts/deb_installer/sign_deb.sh someemail@email.com
```

This will sign all packages.

To verify the signature of a single package use:
```bash
$ dpkg-sig --verify ./deb/skywire_0.5.0-1_amd64.deb
Processing ./deb/skywire_0.5.0-1_amd64.deb...
GOODSIG _gpgbuilder 9A86A72D257E9EEAD3CE6ADDCC2026E6F21CEDA7 1620395902
```

If the package isn't signed, then the output will be `NOSIGN`.
If there is some error, it will be `BADSIG`.
If the package is signed, then the output will be `GOODSIG`. Followed by who signed the package `_gpgbuilder` 
and then the keyid of the key that the package is signed with `9A86A72D257E9EEAD3CE6ADDCC2026E6F21CEDA7`
and lastly the epoch time of when it was signed `1620395902`.
To verify that the correct key was used for the signing, compare the `keyid` with the correct `keyid` from 
`gpg --list-keys`.

To remove old packages from the repo, cd to `/var/www/repos/apt/debian` and use:
```bash
$ reprepro remove stretch skywire
```

This should be repeated for all needed debian releases.

To add new packages to the repo, from the `/var/www/repos/apt/debian` use:
```bash
$ reprepro includedeb jessie ./skywire_0.5.0-1_amd64.deb
```

This should be repeated for all needed debian releases and built packages.

To install the package use:
```
$ sudo dpkg -i ./deb/skywire_0.5.0-1_amd64.deb
```
This will install `skywire` and `skywire-cli`

To generate a config use
```
$ skywire-cli config gen -pro /opt/skywire/skywire-visor.json
```

To uninstall the package use:
```
$ sudo apt-get remove skywire
```

### End User

Import the public key
```bash
$ wget -O - http://subdomain.skycoin.com/public-gpg.key | sudo apt-key add - 
```

Add repo to sources.list

```bash
$ deb http://subdomain.skycoin.com/ skywire main
```

Run
```bash
$ apt-get update
```

To uninstall use:
```
$ sudo apt-get remove skywire
```
